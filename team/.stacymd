Stacy is a WSIS Award recipient (2003), recognised through an invitation to speak at the original World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) for her early contributions to global digital governance. She brings over three decades of systems-level work across technology, open-source leadership, aerospace education, environmental stewardship, and governance systems.
She served as Managing Director for the USENIX System Administration Certification Program, and later as Director of Certification at the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) — contributing to the creation and global rollout of early technical certification and standards programs.
She ran the F1 Grand Prix Rocketry Display for the Australian Defence Force, and was instrumental in the early development of multiple university rocketry clubs in Australia, helping establish national-level maker, robotics, and launch programs. She is also a Master Naturalist and Watershed Steward, integrating ecological literacy with STEM, resilience, and sustainability education. Her broader education portfolio includes renewable-energy and permaculture initiatives across diverse communities, including work with the Navajo and Hopi Nations and the University of New Hampshire's learning-garden and watershed programs.
Stacy's work with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) began in the lead-up to the original WSIS, where she contributed to early digital-governance development and teen inclusion frameworks. She now co-leads the development of the Inclusive Lifelong Multistakeholder Model (ILMM) and the Upstream Safety System (USS) — the world's first deterministic, auditable, policy-first AI safety architecture that enforces Technical Separation of Powers across three governance layers.
Her work focuses on upstream governance, teen inclusion, and building safety infrastructure that embeds ethical standards before harm occurs.
