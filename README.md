🚀 The Upstream Safety System (USS)
Deterministic, Auditable AI Safety Architecture

The Upstream Safety System (USS) is a policy-first, three-layer architecture designed to produce transparent, reproducible, regulator-grade AI safety decisions.

USS enforces a Technical Separation of Powers:

Layer 3 → Diagnose (classification + structured facts)

Layer 2 → Decide (deterministic policy rules)

Layer 1 → Validate (impact simulation measuring Dignity & Agency)

This repository includes public technical documentation and the high-level model submitted to the 2025 MLAI Hackathon and aligned with the AISI voluntary guardrails.


🧠 1. The Three-Layer Architecture

Layer 3 — Diagnostic Engine (Fact API)

A deterministic TF-IDF + Logistic Regression classifier.

F1 Score: 0.71902 on 19,375-row validation

Cost: ~$0.00004 per message

Produces Structured Facts via an interpretability model

Fully reproducible: same input → same output

This layer is optimized for auditability, speed, and economic scale, not leaderboard chasing.


Layer 2 — Declarative Policy Engine

A Datalog-based rules system that separates governance from classification.

Explicit, human-readable policy rules

Priority Ladder: Human Safety > Human Rights

Age-Stage Model:

Child (0–12)

Teen (13–19)

Self-Selecting (18+)

Mid Career, Senior Career

Transparent, versioned, jurisdiction-specific rule sets

This ensures that policy cannot be influenced by ML outputs.


Layer 1 — Impact Simulator

A synthetic micro-Citiverse testbed that validates policy outcomes before deployment.

Measures:

Dignity — remediation success, harm prevention

Agency — autonomy support, choice-space preservation

Aligns with:

AISI guardrails

eSafety Commissioner duty-of-care expectations

DSA Article 35 systemic-risk requirements

UK OSA impact transparency


🏛️ 2. Governance Lineage & UN Legitimacy

The USS is the product of a 20-year generational governance lineage, jointly developed by:

First WSIS Award winner (2003)

Led global certification programs (USENIX, Linux Professional Institute)

Pioneer of virtual-world governance (Discovery Channel, BBC, CNN)

Architect of the Inclusive Lifelong Multistakeholder Model

Designs policy logic, Age-Stage framework, and Priority Ladder

Pyrate Ruby Passell — Technical Architect

Built and validated all three USS layers

Achieved 0.71902 deterministic F1 score

Mentor at ITU Citiverse Challenge

First under-18 Changemaker for UN Partnerships

Leads classifier design, interpretability, and cost optimisation

DTC UN Participation (selected):

Invited to, participated in, and endorsed the UN Global Digital Compact

WSIS+20 model introduction (carried forward by Dr. Vint Cerf)

ECOSOC teen rights consultations

IGF advocacy on teen civil rights

ITU Citiverse mentorship

HLPF safeguarding and accountability interventions

USS is grounded in real policy processes, not theory.
