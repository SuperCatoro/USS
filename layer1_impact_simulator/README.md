# Layer 1 — Impact Simulator

The Impact Simulator validates policy behavior before deployment.

It measures:
- Dignity: remediation success, harm prevention.
- Agency: autonomy support, choice-space preservation.

This provides quantifiable duty-of-care metrics aligned with:
- AISI voluntary guardrails
- eSafety expectations
- DSA Article 35 systemic-risk requirements
- UK Online Safety Act impact transparency

This layer ensures policies improve real-world safety outcomes.
